# Django Rest Framework
<b> Site link: </b>



<strong> Project Description: </strong> This project is a REST API built using Django Rest Framework. 
The API allows clients/users to submit requests to perform various Python functions. 
Each function has a unique endpoint that accepts parameters in the request body. 
The API then returns the result of the function as a JSON response. 
The project is intended to serve as a foundation for building more complex web applications in the future.

<strong> Important things I learned </strong>
<ul>

  <li>Working with serializers</li>
  <li>Handling API CRUD requests using a basic python client & simplejwt</li>

  <li>HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)</li>
  <li>SQLite Database</li>
</ul>
